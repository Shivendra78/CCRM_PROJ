Campus Course Records Manager (CCRM)
Project Overview
Campus Course Records Manager (CCRM) is a Java console application for managing students, courses, enrollments, and grades. It helps administrators add, update, and deactivate students and courses, enroll students, assign grades, calculate GPA, and handle CSV import/export with backup support.

Features
Student Management:Add, list, update, and deactivate students.
Course Management: Add, list, update, and deactivate courses.
Enrollment & Grading: Enroll/unenroll students, record grades, compute GPA.
File Operations:Import/export students, courses, and enrollments using CSV files.
Backup & Utilities:Backup data files and recursive folder size and file listing utilities.
Robust CLI: Command-line interface with input validation, confirmation prompts, and user-friendly menus.
Java Concepts: Use of enums, exceptions, assertions, design patterns (Singleton, Builder), and Java streams.

# The Evolution of Java

Java has a rich history of evolution, constantly improving to meet the needs of modern development. Here's a brief timeline:

* 1995: Java 1.0 - The original release that introduced the "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) philosophy.
* 1997: Java 1.1 - Added new features like inner classes and JDBC (Java Database Connectivity).
* 1998: Java 2 (J2SE, J2EE, J2ME) - A major update that established the three main platforms: Standard Edition, Enterprise Edition, and Micro Edition.
* 2004: Java 5 (J2SE 5.0) - A huge release that brought us generics, enums, and the enhanced for-loop, among other things.
* 2014: Java 8 - A game-changer with the introduction of lambda expressions and the Streams API, making functional programming in Java a reality.
* 2017: Java 9 - Introduced the Java Platform Module System (JPMS), which modularized the JDK.
* 2018: Java 11 - The first long-term support (LTS) release under the new release cadence, which removed some of the older Java EE modules.
* 2023: Java 21 - The latest LTS release, featuring modern concurrency with virtual threads and enhanced pattern matching.

# Java Platform Comparison

Hereâ€™s a simple breakdown of the different Java platforms:

* Java SE (Standard Edition): This is for building standard desktop, server, and embedded applications. It includes the core Java APIs, which is what this project uses.
* Java EE (Enterprise Edition): This platform is for large-scale, multi-tiered enterprise applications. It provides APIs for things like servlets, JSPs, and web services.
* Java ME (Micro Edition): This version is specifically for mobile and embedded devices with limited resources.

# Java Architecture: JDK, JRE, and JVM

The Java platform is built on three key components that work together seamlessly.

* JDK (Java Development Kit): Think of this as the complete toolbox for a Java developer. It includes the compiler ('javac'), a debugger, and all the other tools you need to write and build a Java program.
* JRE (Java Runtime Environment): This is what you need to run a Java program. It includes the JVM and the necessary class libraries. You can't develop with it, but you can definitely run applications.
* JVM (Java Virtual Machine): This is the magic behind Java's "Write Once, Run Anywhere" philosophy. The JVM takes the platform-independent bytecode from your compiled code and translates it into code that your computer can understand and execute.

# Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

* Java 8 or higher
* Any Java IDE (like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or VS Code)
* Command-line access

#### Installation & Setup

1. Clone or download the project
'git clone <repository-url>'
'cd campus-course-records-manager'

2. Compile the project
'javac -d . src/main/java/com/ccrm/*.java src/main/java/com/ccrm/**/*.java'

3. Run the application
'java com.ccrm.CampusCourseRecordsManager'

# Setting up the Project in Eclipse IDE

1. Launch Eclipse and select File > Import...
2. Choose Git > Projects from Git (with smart import) and click Next.
3. Select Clone URI and paste the project's repository URL. Click Next.
4. Choose the main branch and click Next.
5. Set the local directory for the project and click Next.
6. Eclipse will automatically recognize it as a Java project. Click Finish.

Now that the project is in your workspace, you can run it by right-clicking on 'CampusCourseRecordsManager.java' in the Package Explorer and selecting Run As > Java Application.

# Project Requirements Mapping

Here's a quick look at where you can find each key concept implemented in the code:

* Encapsulation: You'll find private fields with public getters and setters in files like 'model/Person.java' and 'model/Student.java', ensuring controlled data access.
* Inheritance: The abstract 'Person' class is the base for 'Student' and 'Instructor', allowing them to share common properties and behaviors.
* Abstraction: The 'Person' class defines abstract methods like 'getRole()' that its subclasses must implement, setting a clear contract.
* Polymorphism: A 'Person' reference can hold either a 'Student' or an 'Instructor' object, showcasing flexible code design.
* Singleton Pattern: The 'DataStore' class ensures that only one instance exists throughout the application to manage all data centrally.
* Builder Pattern: The 'CourseBuilder' and 'TranscriptBuilder' are used for building complex objects step-by-step.
* Custom Exceptions: We use our own exceptions like 'MaxCreditLimitExceededException' for more specific error handling.
* NIO.2: Modern file operations using the 'Path' and 'Files' APIs are demonstrated in 'utils/FileUtils.java' and 'utils/BackupUtils.java'.
* Streams: The Streams API is used for declarative data processing and filtering in files like 'core/DataStore.java' and 'services/StudentService.java'.
* Date/Time API: 'LocalDate' is used to handle dates without time zones in 'model/Student.java' and 'model/Enrollment.java'.
* Enums: Our enums like 'Semester.java' and 'Grade.java' provide type-safe constants with associated data and methods.
* Recursion: You can see recursive directory traversal and operations in the 'utils/BackupUtils.java' file.

# Enabling Assertions

To enable assertions, you just need to use the '-ea' flag when you run the Java application from the command line. This is super helpful for debugging and for internal consistency checks.

Sample Command:

'java -ea com.ccrm.CampusCourseRecordsManager'
